## Realtime chat app

This is a realtime chat app built as part of the Careerfoundry curriculum. It uses React Native to run the code and a Firebase database on the back end. The app allows a user to send chats, pictures and share his/her location form IOS or Android mobile phones. When there is no wifi available the chats are loaded form asyncStorage.

## Using the app

To use this app, download the code locally. Then run the app with **expo start**. In Expo you can choose to run the app in the web brwoser or a IOS, or android emulator.
